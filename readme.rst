About the Programmer
###################

My name is Bibek Sigdel and I am a software engineer graduated from Trivuwan University, Nepal.
During my final year of degree, I was provided with an opportunity to work for a hongkong based
web developement company named Cross-over Nepal. There I worked with senior programmers to design and
developed various web application modules for large scale website www.polifonic.io . I was able to learn 
various tools and technologies such as PHP Symfony, MySQL, GIT, Linux, JSON and so on.

Once I successfully completed my term as a trainiee and was promoted to Junior developer position, I was offered 
to sign a 2 years contract with the company, which I could not and had to leave the company.

Then, I joined another company named "Rigorous Web Nepal" where I was responsible to develop backed system and plugins for 
wordpress sites. Eventually, I decided to come to Australia for further studies and joined Masters of Information System course in Central Queensland University.

Fast forward to December, 2019, I have now graduated from CQU and I am looking for entry level web developement opportunities in Australian IT firms. To prove my technical skills, I have used my github profile to upload my projects and showcase my programming skills.
